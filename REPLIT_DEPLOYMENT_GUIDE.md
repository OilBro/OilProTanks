## üìä Using the Calculator

### Input Parameters
- **Tank Diameter**: In feet
- **Tank Height**: In feet  
- **Specific Gravity**: Of stored product (typically 0.8-1.0)
- **Joint Efficiency**: Weld quality factor (typically 1.0)
- **Allowable Stress**: Material strength in psi (typically 23,000 for A36 steel)
- **Original Thickness**: New plate thickness in inches
