- âœ… No arbitrary restrictions
- âœ… Better performance than Replit

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure to add `MANUS_API_KEY` to your hosting platform's environment variables
2. **Domain Updates**: Update `CLIENT_URL` and `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to match your new domain
3. **Database**: Currently using in-memory storage (fine for testing, can upgrade to PostgreSQL later)

## ðŸ†˜ If You Need Help

1. Download your Replit as a ZIP
2. Extract it to your computer
3. Push it to a new GitHub repository
4. Follow the Railway deployment steps above

Your app will be running reliably in minutes! No more Replit sabotage! ðŸŽ‰
