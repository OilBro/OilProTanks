# Phase 3 Fixes - Excel Import and Data Integrity

## Issues Identified:
1. Imported reports create dashboard entries but underlying inspection reports are missing ("Report Not Found")
2. Tank IDs are incorrectly set to Excel filenames; service types are inconsistent ("crude_oil" vs "Crude Oil")
3. Multi-tank imports are parsed incorrectly
4. Findings field is passed incorrectly to the Inspection object, breaking saves (ALREADY FIXED in Phase 1)
5. No data validation, error handling, or cleanup of orphaned dashboard entries

## Analysis:
- Excel import handler exists but has data mapping and validation issues
- Tank ID extraction logic needs improvement
- Service type standardization is needed
- Multi-sheet processing needs enhancement
- Error handling and cleanup mechanisms are missing

## Fixes to Implement:
1. Improve Tank ID extraction from Excel data
2. Standardize service type mapping
3. Enhance multi-sheet processing
4. Add comprehensive data validation
5. Implement error handling and cleanup for orphaned entries
6. Fix report creation to ensure underlying data is properly linked


## Fixes Implemented:

### 1. Enhanced Tank ID Extraction
- Prioritize Tank ID extraction from Excel data over filename
- Added comprehensive Tank ID pattern matching (Tank ID, Tank Number, Vessel ID, Equipment ID, etc.)
- Intelligent filename parsing as fallback with tank-specific patterns
- Proper logging of Tank ID extraction process

### 2. Standardized Service Type Mapping
- Implemented comprehensive service type standardization
- Added mapping for common variations (crude oil → crude_oil, gas → gasoline, etc.)
- Enhanced detection from product/contents fields in Excel data
- Consistent service type format across the application

### 3. Enhanced Multi-Sheet Processing
- Added multi-tank detection capability
- Enhanced sheet-by-sheet processing with tank identification
- Added source tracking for measurements (sourceSheet, sourceTankId)
- Improved logging for multi-tank workbook detection
- Better handling of tank-specific data from different sheets

### 4. Comprehensive Error Handling and Cleanup
- Enhanced validation error messages with specific field guidance
- Added error categorization (file_error, format_error, timeout_error, etc.)
- Improved user feedback with actionable suggestions
- Better error details extraction for validation issues
- Comprehensive error logging with timestamps

### 5. Data Validation Improvements
- Enhanced numeric field parsing with unit handling
- Better date format validation and conversion
- Improved field mapping with expanded pattern recognition
- Robust data type conversion and validation
- Proper handling of missing or invalid data

### 6. Fixed Report Creation Issues
- Findings field handling already fixed in Phase 1
- Enhanced data validation before report creation
- Better error recovery and data preservation
- Improved linking between imported data and created reports
