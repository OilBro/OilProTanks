## System Errors Encountered

### 1. Thickness Measurement Data Persistence Issue
**Problem**: Added 4 thickness measurements (Shell Course 1, Shell Course 2, Bottom Plate, Critical Zone) but only 2 were saved after the save operation.

**Details**:
- Expected: 4 measurements with calculations
- Actual: Only Shell Course 1 and Shell Course 2 saved successfully
- Missing: Bottom Plate and Critical Zone measurements
- Impact: Affects completeness of thickness assessment section

**Workaround**: Re-entry of missing measurements may be required

### 2. No Other Significant Errors
- PDF generation worked flawlessly
- All other data entry and saving operations successful
- System navigation and interface functionality excellent

## PDF Report Generation Results

### ✅ SUCCESS - PDF Generated Successfully
- **Confirmation**: System displayed "PDF Generated - Report AUDIT-TEST-2025-002 has been downloaded successfully"
- **Process**: No errors during PDF generation
- **Content Verification**: All entered sections appear to be included in the generated report
- **Download**: PDF successfully created and made available for download

## Technical Assessment

### System Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Interface**: Covers all major API 653 inspection requirements
2. **Automatic Calculations**: Real-time corrosion rate and remaining life calculations
3. **Professional Layout**: Well-organized tabs and sections
4. **PDF Generation**: Reliable report generation functionality
