OilPro Tanks - What's Not Working

Issues Found:

1.
Thickness calculations not working - Shows "Auto-calculated" instead of performing math

2.
Thickness measurements not saving - Add button doesn't store data in database

3.
Settlement analysis completely broken - "New Survey" button does nothing

4.
Settlement analysis tabs not working - Data Entry/Analysis Results/Survey History tabs don't switch

5.
PDF download not working - Download PDF button in preview is unresponsive

6.
Settlement charts not generating - No cosine curve charts or R² calculations

7.
Some CSV/PDF imports fail - Error messages on certain file imports




Potential Fixes (My Technical Insights):

1. Thickness Calculations Fix

Problem: JavaScript calculation functions not executing
Likely Fix:

•
Check if calculation event listeners are attached to the "Add" button

•
Verify the calculation formulas: corrosionRate = (original - current) / years * 1000

•
Ensure the calculation results are being displayed in the UI elements

•
Check browser console for JavaScript errors

2. Data Persistence Fix

Problem: Database INSERT operations failing
Likely Fix:

•
Verify database connection in backend

•
Check if the API endpoint for saving measurements is working

•
Ensure proper data validation before database insertion

•
Check for SQL syntax errors in INSERT statements

3. Settlement Analysis Fix

Problem: Modal/form not appearing for new surveys
Likely Fix:

•
Check if the "New Survey" button has proper event listener attached

•
Verify if modal HTML elements exist in the DOM

•
Check for JavaScript errors preventing modal display

•
Ensure CSS isn't hiding the modal (z-index, display properties)

4. Tab Navigation Fix

Problem: Tab switching JavaScript not working
Likely Fix:

•
Verify tab click event handlers are properly bound

•
Check if tab content divs exist and have correct IDs

•
Ensure tab state management is updating active/inactive classes

•
Look for JavaScript errors in tab switching functions

5. PDF Export Fix

Problem: PDF generation or download mechanism broken
Likely Fix:

•
Check if PDF library (like jsPDF or similar) is properly loaded

•
Verify the download trigger mechanism

•
Ensure PDF generation function is receiving report data correctly

•
Check for CORS issues if PDF generation is server-side

6. Settlement Charts Fix

Problem: Chart generation library not working
Likely Fix:

•
Verify chart library (Chart.js, D3.js, etc.) is loaded

•
Implement cosine curve fitting algorithm for settlement data

•
Ensure chart container elements exist in DOM

•
Add R² calculation function for statistical analysis

7. File Import Fix

Problem: File parsing or validation errors
Likely Fix:

•
Add better error handling for unsupported file formats

•
Implement file size validation before processing

•
Check file parsing libraries for Excel/PDF processing

•
Add user feedback for specific import errors
