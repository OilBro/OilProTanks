   - Location: East Side, 3-8 ft elevation
   - Original Thickness: 0.500 in
   - Current Thickness: 0.475 in
   - Corrosion Rate: 0.0025 in/yr (calculated automatically)
   - Remaining Life: 90.0 years (calculated automatically)
   - Status: Acceptable ✓

**Key Findings:**
- System automatically calculates corrosion rates and remaining life
- All calculations appear accurate based on (Original - Current) / Years Since Last Inspection
- Status assessment is working properly
- Need to continue adding more components: Bottom Plate, Nozzles, Critical Zone, etc.

**Next Steps:**
- Add Bottom Plate measurements (critical component)
- Add Nozzle measurements
- Add Critical Zone measurements
- Fill other sections: Appurtenance Inspection, Venting System, NDE Results, etc.
- Save report to access Settlement Analysis features



### ERROR ENCOUNTERED: Thickness Measurements Not Fully Saved

**Issue Description:**
- Added 4 thickness measurements: Shell Course 1, Shell Course 2, Bottom Plate, and Critical Zone
- After saving, only 2 measurements are showing: Shell Course 1 and Shell Course 2
- Bottom Plate and Critical Zone measurements appear to have been lost during save operation

**Expected vs Actual:**
- Expected: 4 thickness measurements with calculations
- Actual: Only 2 measurements saved successfully

**Impact:**
- Critical components (Bottom Plate, Critical Zone) missing from report
- This affects the completeness of the API 653 inspection report

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with Settlement Analysis and other sections
- Will attempt to re-add missing measurements later
- Document this as a system limitation/bug

### ERROR VERIFICATION RESULTS - August 28, 2025

**Test Objective:** Verify if the thickness measurement persistence issue has been corrected.

**Test Performed:**
1. Navigated back to report AUDIT-TEST-2025-002
2. Accessed edit mode and went to Measurements tab
3. Successfully added Bottom Plate measurement:
   - Component: Bottom Plate (Default: 0.25")
   - Location: "Center area, Grid B-3"
   - Current Thickness: 0.218"
4. Clicked "Save All Changes" - system showed "Saving..." indicator
5. Returned to report view to verify persistence

**RESULTS:**
❌ **ERROR STILL EXISTS** - The thickness measurement persistence issue has NOT been corrected.

**Evidence:**
- Report still shows "Thickness Measurements (2)" instead of expected 3
- Only Shell Course 1 and Shell Course 2 measurements are displayed
- Bottom Plate measurement was lost during the save operation
- Same behavior as originally documented

**Conclusion:**
The system developers have NOT fixed the data persistence issue for thickness measurements. The error remains exactly as originally reported:
- Expected: All thickness measurements to be saved and displayed
- Actual: Only some measurements persist after save operations
- Impact: Critical thickness data loss affecting report completeness

**System Status:** ERROR PERSISTS - NO IMPROVEMENT DETECTED

1. Created new report RETEST-2025-001
2. Selected Bottom Plate component
3. Entered location: "Center area, Grid B-3"
4. Entered current thickness: 0.218"
5. Successfully saved report as draft
6. Reopened report for verification

**Results:**
- ❌ Bottom Plate component selection was lost (shows "Select Component")
- ❌ Location description was lost (shows "Location" placeholder)
- ❌ Current thickness changed from 0.218" to 0.485" (default value)

**Conclusion:**
Despite significant interface improvements and new features, the core thickness measurement persistence issue remains **UNFIXED**. The system continues to lose specific component measurements during save operations, particularly for Bottom Plate and other non-shell components.

**Impact:**
- Critical thickness data loss persists
- Incomplete audit reports continue to be generated
- API 653 compliance issues remain unresolved
- Professional inspection workflow still compromised

**Status:** ERROR CONFIRMED - NO IMPROVEMENT IN DATA PERSISTENCE
