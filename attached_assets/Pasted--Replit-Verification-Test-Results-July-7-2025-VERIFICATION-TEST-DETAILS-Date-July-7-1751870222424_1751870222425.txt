**Report mentioned as working:** IMP-1751863325467  
**Claimed status:** "Successfully created with 177 thickness measurements"  
**Claimed functionality:** "Full report created and accessible"

### ACTUAL TEST RESULTS

**Report ID:** IMP-1751863325467

- ‚ùå **No actual report data** - Despite dashboard entry

### System Status Confirmation

- **System Functionality:** Complete failure of report retrieval

## üéØ CONCLUSION

**The claims that the system is working are INCORRECT.**

**Evidence:**
1. **Specific report mentioned as working (IMP-1751863325467) is NOT accessible**
2. **"Report Not Found" error confirms no actual report data exists**
3. **Dashboard entries are "ghost records" without underlying data**
4. **Complete system failure affecting ALL reports, not just Excel imports**

## üìä DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS

### What's Being Claimed:
- ‚úÖ Excel Import Working
- ‚úÖ Report Creation Successful  
- ‚úÖ Database Storage Working
- ‚úÖ All Endpoints Functional
- ‚úÖ 100% Functionality

### What's Actually Happening:
- ‚ùå No reports accessible
- ‚ùå Complete database/backend failure
- ‚ùå All report endpoints returning 404
- ‚ùå 0% report accessibility
- ‚ùå Critical system outage

## üö® CRITICAL ALERT

**The system is experiencing a COMPLETE OUTAGE despite claims otherwise.**

**Evidence is clear and verifiable:**
- Direct URL testing shows "Report Not Found" for ALL reports
- Even the specifically mentioned "working" report fails
- Dashboard shows metadata but no actual reports exist
- This is a critical production failure requiring immediate attention

**Recommendation:** Focus on restoring basic report functionality before any other development work.
