Executive Summary

This re-audit was conducted to assess whether critical issues identified in the previous comprehensive audit of the OilPro Tanks API 653 inspection application have been resolved. The findings reveal that NO IMPROVEMENTS have been made to address the core functionality failures that render the application unsuitable for regulatory compliance.

Critical Findings - NO CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS AUDIT

ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Thickness Calculation Engine - STILL BROKEN

Status: COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL
Impact: REGULATORY COMPLIANCE FAILURE

The core thickness calculation functionality remains completely broken:

â€¢
Input: Original 0.500", Current 0.485", 10 years service

â€¢
Expected: 1.5 mpy corrosion rate, 256.7 years remaining life

â€¢
Actual: "Auto-calculated" (no calculation performed)

ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Settlement Analysis System - STILL BROKEN

Status: COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL
Impact: API 653 ANNEX B COMPLIANCE FAILURE

Settlement analysis per API 653 Annex B remains inoperative:

â€¢
Cannot create new settlement surveys

â€¢
Error message: "Failed to create survey"

â€¢
No cosine curve analysis capability

â€¢
No chart generation functionality

ðŸŸ¡ PARTIAL: Report Generation - WORKS BUT USELESS

Status: TECHNICALLY FUNCTIONAL BUT PRODUCES EMPTY REPORTS
Impact: REPORTS LACK CRITICAL DATA

Report generation system can create reports but they contain no meaningful data due to calculation engine failures.

What Is Not Working (Unchanged from Previous Audit)

1.
Thickness calculation engine - Shows "Auto-calculated" instead of performing calculations

2.
Data persistence for thickness measurements - Calculations not saved or displayed

3.
Settlement analysis system - Cannot create surveys, displays "Failed to create survey" error

4.
Chart and diagram generation - No settlement charts or visual analysis tools working

5.
PDF export verification - Cannot confirm if PDFs are actually generated

6.
Corrosion rate calculations - No mathematical processing of thickness data

7.
Remaining life calculations - Critical safety assessments not performed

8.
Status determination - Cannot assess component condition (Acceptable/Monitor/Action Required)

Recommended Fixes (Same as Previous Audit)

1. Fix Thickness Calculation Engine

â€¢
Issue: JavaScript calculation functions not executing

â€¢
Fix: Debug and repair the calculation logic in the thickness measurement module

â€¢
Priority: CRITICAL - Required for basic functionality

2. Fix Settlement Analysis System

â€¢
Issue: Survey creation fails with error message

â€¢
Fix: Repair database operations and survey creation logic

â€¢
Priority: CRITICAL - Required for API 653 Annex B compliance

3. Implement Proper Data Persistence

â€¢
Issue: Calculated values not being saved to database

â€¢
Fix: Ensure calculation results are properly stored and retrieved

â€¢
Priority: HIGH - Required for data integrity

4. Add Chart Generation Capabilities

â€¢
Issue: No visual analysis tools for settlement data

â€¢
Fix: Implement cosine curve plotting and settlement visualization

â€¢
Priority: HIGH - Required for comprehensive analysis

5. Verify PDF Export Functionality

â€¢
Issue: Cannot confirm PDF generation works

â€¢
Fix: Test and validate PDF creation and download process

â€¢
Priority: MEDIUM - Required for report delivery

Conclusion

The OilPro Tanks application remains in the same non-functional state as identified in the previous audit. The core calculation engines that are essential for API 653 compliance are completely broken, making the application unsuitable for professional tank inspection work.

Recommendation: Do not use this application for actual API 653 inspections until all critical calculation and analysis functions are repaired and thoroughly tested.

Development Priority: Focus immediately on repairing the thickness calculation engine and settlement analysis system before addressing any other features or enhancements.
