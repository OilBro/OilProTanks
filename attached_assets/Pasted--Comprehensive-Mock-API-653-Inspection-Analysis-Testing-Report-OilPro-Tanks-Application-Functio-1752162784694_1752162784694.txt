## Critical Findings

### PDF Generation System Failure

The most significant finding of this comprehensive test was the complete failure of the PDF generation system. Despite successfully capturing extensive inspection data across all major categories, the application consistently returned "PDF Generation Failed" errors with the message "Error: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toUpperCase')."

This technical error indicates a fundamental flaw in the PDF generation engine that prevents the conversion of collected inspection data into deliverable reports. The error suggests null value handling issues within the PDF generation code, likely related to data formatting or template processing failures.

**Impact Assessment:** This failure renders the entire application unusable for professional API 653 inspection services, as the primary deliverable—a comprehensive inspection report—cannot be generated regardless of the quality or completeness of the collected data.
