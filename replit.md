```
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
File handling: User has existing Excel-based inspection reports (XLSM format) that may need import functionality.
Excel field mappings:
- Equipment ID = Tank Number/Tank ID

- Nominal Thickness = Original Thickness
- Findings section includes: Executive Summary with repair recommendations and next inspection date
Business Rules: NO cost estimation for repair recommendations
```
