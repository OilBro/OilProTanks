# API 653 Inspector - Tank Inspection Management System

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built for managing API 653 tank inspection reports. The system enables inspectors to create, manage, and generate professional inspection reports for storage tanks, with features for thickness measurements, inspection checklists, and PDF report generation.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon Database)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between client and server

## User Preferences

```
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
File handling: User has existing Excel-based inspection reports (XLSM format) that may need import functionality.
Excel field mappings:
- Equipment ID = Tank Number/Tank ID
- Report Write Up = Comprehensive findings (Foundation, Shell, Roof, Floor/Bottom, Nozzles, NDE Results)
- Nominal Thickness = Original Thickness
- Findings section includes: Executive Summary with repair recommendations and next inspection date
Business Rules: NO cost estimation for repair recommendations
```
