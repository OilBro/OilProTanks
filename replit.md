# API 653 Inspector - Tank Inspection Management System

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built for managing API 653 tank inspection reports. The system enables inspectors to create, manage, and generate professional inspection reports for storage tanks, with features for thickness measurements, inspection checklists, and PDF report generation.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon Database)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between client and server
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with the following schema:
  - `inspection_reports`: Main report records with metadata
  - `thickness_measurements`: Corrosion and thickness data points
  - `inspection_checklists`: Standardized inspection items
  - `report_templates`: Reusable report configurations
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL

## Key Components

### Core Features
1. **Dashboard**: Overview of all inspection reports with status tracking
2. **Report Creation**: Step-by-step report generation with form validation
3. **Comprehensive Thickness Management**: 
   - Shell course measurements
   - Bottom plate readings with grid references
   - Internal annular ring measurements
   - Critical zone assessments
   - External repad inspections
   - Roof thickness readings (center, edge, nozzle areas)
   - Chime area measurements
   - Nozzle and flange inspections
4. **Settlement Surveys**: Internal and external elevation measurements
5. **Dyke & Secondary Containment**: Primary/secondary containment inspections
6. **Checklist System**: Standardized inspection items for external/internal components
7. **Excel Import**: Smart field detection for existing inspection reports
8. **PDF Generation**: Professional report output using jsPDF
9. **Template System**: Reusable report templates for different tank services

### Calculation Engine
- **Corrosion Rate Calculation**: Based on original vs current thickness over time
- **Remaining Life Estimation**: Predictive analysis for maintenance planning
- **Status Classification**: Automatic categorization (acceptable, monitor, action required)

### UI Components
- Custom React components built on shadcn/ui foundation
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Dark/light theme support through CSS custom properties
- Accessible components following ARIA guidelines

## Data Flow

1. **Report Creation**: User fills out basic tank information and inspection details
2. **Thickness Measurements**: Inspector adds measurement data with automatic calculations
3. **Inspection Checklist**: Standardized items are checked off during inspection
4. **Report Generation**: All data is compiled into a professional PDF report
5. **Data Persistence**: All information is stored in PostgreSQL for future reference

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Framework**: React, React DOM, Vite
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives, Lucide React icons
- **Forms**: React Hook Form, Hookform Resolvers
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority, clsx
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date formatting
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF for client-side PDF creation
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query

### Backend Dependencies
- **Server**: Express.js for HTTP server
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, Neon Database serverless driver
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the stack
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code formatting and linting
- **Vite Plugins**: Development experience enhancements
- **Replit Integration**: Cartographer plugin for Replit environment

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev` runs both client and server
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for frontend, tsx watch mode for backend
- **Port Configuration**: Server on port 5000, proxied through Vite

### Production Build
- **Frontend Build**: Vite builds optimized static assets
- **Backend Build**: esbuild bundles server code for Node.js
- **Output**: Compiled assets in `dist/` directory
- **Deployment Target**: Replit Autoscale with PostgreSQL module

### Database Management
- **Schema Migrations**: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes
- **Environment Variables**: `DATABASE_URL` for database connection
- **Connection Pooling**: Neon Database handles connection management
