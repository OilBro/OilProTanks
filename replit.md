# API 653 Inspector - Tank Inspection Management System

## Overview
This is a full-stack web application designed for managing API 653 tank inspection reports. Its primary purpose is to enable inspectors to efficiently create, manage, and generate professional inspection reports for storage tanks. Key capabilities include comprehensive thickness measurements, detailed inspection checklists, settlement surveys, dyke and secondary containment inspections, and automated PDF report generation. The system aims to streamline the inspection process, ensure compliance with API 653 standards, and provide predictive analysis for maintenance planning, ultimately enhancing safety and efficiency in tank management.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
File handling: User has existing Excel-based inspection reports (XLSM format) that may need import functionality.
Excel field mappings:
- Equipment ID = Tank Number/Tank ID
- Report Write Up = Comprehensive findings (Foundation, Shell, Roof, Floor/Bottom, Nozzles, NDE Results)
- Nominal Thickness = Original Thickness
- Findings section includes: Executive Summary with repair recommendations and next inspection date
Business Rules: NO cost estimation for repair recommendations
