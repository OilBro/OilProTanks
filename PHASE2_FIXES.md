# Phase 2 Fixes - PDF Generation and Export

## Issues Identified:
1. PDF reports are generated with missing or placeholder data ("Auto-calculated", "---", or empty tables)
2. Professional fields (NDE results, recommendations, checklists, sketches) are not included
3. Date formatting issues (shows "Invalid Date")
4. PDF download functionality fails or is inconsistent
5. No error handling or logging for failed PDF generation

## Analysis:
- The PDF generator exists but has data mapping issues
- Date validation is present but may not handle all edge cases
- Error handling exists but could be improved
- Missing sections need to be added to the PDF template

## Fixes to Implement:
1. Improve data validation and formatting before PDF generation
2. Add missing professional sections to PDF template
3. Enhance error handling and logging
4. Fix date formatting issues
5. Ensure all required sections are included
